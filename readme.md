# Recetop API

A Spring Boot REST API for managing recipes, built with Java 17, Spring Data JPA, and H2 in-memory database. The API uses DTOs for data transfer and supports OpenAPI documentation via springdoc.

## Features

- CRUD operations for recipes
- DTO mapping for API responses
- In-memory H2 database for development/testing
- OpenAPI (Swagger UI) documentation

## Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vifor/recetop-api.git
   cd recetop-api
   ```

2. **Build and run the application:**
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Access the API:**
   - API root: [http://localhost:8080/recipes](http://localhost:8080/recipes)
   - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
   - H2 Console: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)

## Authentication

Protected endpoints on this API require a Bearer Token to be sent in the `Authorization` header.

**Header Format:**
`Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`

For development and testing purposes, the following hardcoded token can be used:
`my-super-secret-jwt-token-for-testing`

## Testing with Postman

A Postman collection is included to make testing the API endpoints easy. You can import the collection to your Postman client to get started right away.

1.  Download the collection file located at `postman/recetop-api.postman_collection.json`.
2.  In Postman, click the "Import" button.
3.  Upload the downloaded file. A new collection named "recetop-api" will appear in your collections tab.
